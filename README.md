## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The linear regression model of our datase is:
mpg = 6.26 vl + .001vw + .07sa + 3.55gc -3.41AWD - 104.02

All Pr(>|t|) values represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model, specifically the coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values are the vehicle lenght, ground clearance and the intercept.

According to our results, vehicle length, ground clearance and the intercept have a significant impact on the MechaCar mpg, therefore we can reject the null hipothesis that says that the slope of the linear model is equal to zero. The intercept is statistically significant and it means it can explain a lot of variability on the dependent variable.

This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because it has an R-squared value of .714, so there's a strong correlation.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch, but as we can see Lot #3 doesnt meet the especifications, because it has a variance of 170.28.
