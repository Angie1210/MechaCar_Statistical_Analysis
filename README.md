## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The lienar regression model of our datase is:
mpg = 6.26 vl + .001vw + .07sa + 3.55gc -3.41AWD - 104.02

All Pr(>|t|) values represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model, specifically the coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values are the vehicle lenght, ground clearance and the intercept.

According to our results, vehicle length, ground clearance and the intercept have a significant impact on the MechaCar mpg, therefore we can reject the null hipothesis that says that the slope of the linear model is equal to zero. The intercept is statistically significant and it means it can explain a lot of variability on the dependent variable.

This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because it has an R-squared value of .714, so there's a strong correlation.
